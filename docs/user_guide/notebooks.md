## Understanding the Notebooks Generated


When you run this build script successfully, you will see a series of notebooks generated in your ==my_project==/target/notebooks directory. This is the `"special sauce"` of this dbt-adapter that allows your to run your dbt project natively as notebooks in a Fabric workspace. The image below shows a sample listing of generated notebooks. Your specific notebooks will be contain the name of your dbt project and may be different depending on the models and tests that you have defined in your dbt project. 

#### Sample listing of Generated Notebooks

If you study the files shown above you will notice that there is a naming convention and that the notebooks are prefixed with a specific string. The following table explains at a high level the naming convention and the purpose of each type of notebook.

| Notebook Prefix | Description               |
| --------------- | --------------------------|
|  model.         |  These are dbt **model** notebooks. A notebook will be generated for each dbt **model** that you define. You will be able to run, debug and monitor execution of these notebooks directly in the Fabric portal independently of dbt.|
|  test.          |  These are dbt **test** notebooks. A notebook will be generated for each dbt **test** that you define. You will be able to run, debug and monitor execution of these notebooks directly in the Fabric portal independently of dbt. |
|  seed.          |  These are dbt **seed** notebooks. A notebook will be generated for each dbt **seed** that you define. You will be able to run, debug and monitor execution of these notebooks directly in the Fabric portal independently of dbt.|
|  master_        |  These are **execution orchestration** notebooks. They allow the running of your models, tests and seeds in parallel and in the correct order. They are what allow you to run your transformation pipelines independently of dbt as an orchestrator. In order to run your project simply schedule master.{project_name}.notebook.iypnb using Fabric's native scheduling functionality |
|  import_        |  This is a helper notebook that facilitate import of generated notebooks into workspace.  |
|  metadata_      |  This is a helper notebook to facilitate generation of workspace metadata json files.    |

??? Question "Notebooks with the Prefix `"model."`"
    These are dbt **model** notebooks. A notebook will be generated for each dbt **model** that you define. You will be able to run, debug and monitor execution of these notebooks directly in the Fabric portal independently of dbt.

    This is a helper notebook to facilitates the generation of workspace metadata json files.


## Notebooks in your Fabric Workspace
If you login to your fabric workspace and navigate to the notebooks section you will see that the generated notebooks have been uploaded to your workspace.

!!! tip
    I suggest that you move your notebooks into a folder that matches the name of your dbt project.
